Child Care Subsidy (Quadra) is used to process Child Care Subsidy forms submitted by the US Coast Guard, National Park Service (NPS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and GSA families. These forms are entered into this application, reviewed for validity and eligibility, and then used to pay invoices to childcare providers for qualifying employees. The child care subsidy program provides financial assistance to eligible families to assist with child care costs, and provides financial assistance to employees who have children enrolled, or who will be enrolled, in Licensed or Accredited Family Care Homes or Child Care Centers. Financial Operations and Disbursement Division and the External Services Branch use Child Care Subsidy to pay invoices to childcare providers for employees participating in the child care subsidy program. GSA pays the difference between the the actual costs and the family portion, as long as the actual costs do not exceed the maximum amounts for the most expensive GSA-sponsored child care center in the specified region.
